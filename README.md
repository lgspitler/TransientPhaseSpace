Transient phase space diagram as seen in Nimmo et al. 2021 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11446.pdf), heavily inspired by Evan Keane's TPS code (https://github.com/FRBs/Transient_Phase_Space).

The references for all the data points can be found in the caption of Figure 2 in the above paper.

##TransientPhaseSpace
Forked from Kenzie's github

Expanded it to include longer transients using some of the data from Evan Keane's code (link above). 

- Non-repeating FRBs: The list is current incomplete and only contains one-offs with redshifts from host galaxy associations. 

- The following files were copied from Evan's repository:

Gosia_GRB2.txt		Gosia_XRB2.txt
Gosia_SN2.txt		Gosia_flare_stars2.txt
solar_bursts.txt
gw170817.txt
brown_dwarf.txt

- I modified solar_system.txt

- I added a Long Period Transients file:

LPT.txt
