Transient phase space diagram as seen in Nimmo et al. 2021 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11446.pdf), heavily inspired by Evan Keane's TPS code (https://github.com/FRBs/Transient_Phase_Space).

The references for all the data points can be found in the caption of Figure 2 in the above paper.

##TransientPhaseSpace
Forked from Kenzie's github

Expanded it to include longer transients (SNe, GRB, LPTs, etc.) using some of the data from Evan Keane's code (link above). 

Script for this plot: short_long_dur_transients.py

Notes: 

- Non-repeating FRBs: The list is incomplete. Only one-offs with redshifts from host galaxy associations. 

- The following files were copied from Evan's repository: Gosia_GRB2.txt, Gosia_XRB2.txt, Gosia_SN2.txt, Gosia_flare_stars2.txt, solar_bursts.txt, gw170817.txt, brown_dwarf.txt

- I updated the value for Jupiter DAM "solar_system.txt".

- I added a Long Period Transients file: LPT.txt
